# Data-Structures
Data Structures are divided into two types linear and non-linear.

Linear data structures include Array, Linked List, Queue and Stack.
Nonlinear data structures include Tree and Graph.

> Stack and It's Implementations
a. Balance Parenthesis
b. Expressions and their conversions
c. Stock Span
d. Maximum Area of Histogram
e. Smallest to the left, right and vice verca

> Queues and it's applications\n
a. Negative in K sized window
b. Level order traversal of tree
c. Circular Tour
d. First Non Repeating Char in Stream

> Linked List
a. Mid of Linked List
b. In Place Reversal of Linked List
c. Reverse k groups in linked list
d. Cycle detection in linked list
e. Interleave first and second half of Linked List

> Binary Tree
a. Traversals of Binary Tree
b. Height of Binary Tree
c. Diameter of Binary Tree
d. Max, Min from Binary Tree

> Binary Search Trees
a. Max, Min in BST
b. Add new node in BST
c. Delete heavy path
d. Delete a Node
e. Validate BST

> Graphs
a. BFS
b. DFS
c. Detect Cycle
d. Find Islands

> Dynamic Programming
a. Coin Exchange
b. Knapsack 0/1

> Heaps
a. Min, Max Heaps
